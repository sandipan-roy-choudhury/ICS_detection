# Smart Grid Intrusion Detection System

This project focuses on detecting cyber intrusions in smart grid communication networks using machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyze network traffic patterns and identify malicious activities that could compromise grid reliability and security.

The project uses packet-level and flow-level features extracted from network traffic datasets that simulate industrial control system (ICS) communication. A supervised learning approach is used to classify traffic as normal or attack.

## Objectives
- Understand smart grid communication behavior
- Extract meaningful network features from traffic data
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for intrusion detection
- Analyze model performance and detection accuracy

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Wireshark / PCAP-based analysis
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Status
Initial setup completed. Dataset analysis and feature extraction in progress.
